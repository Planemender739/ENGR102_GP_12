#This activity is meant to help illustrate the process of breaking more complex processes into sequential steps, and some of the choices and assumptions involved in #doing so.
#
#To begin, each member of your team should individually create a sequence of instructions for a person to get from your classroom in ZACH to your choice of a) the E. #Ring Plaza” is not a good instruction, while “Turn left”, “Walk straight until you are in front of the H2O fountain”, “Stop after you pass Rudder Tower,” etc. are #reasonable. It might help you to bring up aggiemap.tamu.edu, for a map of campus.
#
#
#Next, as a team, you should look at each member’s instructions one-by-one. Comment on each set of instructions, specifically noting whether the instructions are clear, #whether they provide sufficient detail, and whether they would get someone to the destination. The person who wrote the instructions should not comment on their own #instructions. BEFORE MOVING ON: Discuss as a team: Which one of the sets of instructions do you consider the “best”? Why?
#DO NOT READ UNTIL TASK 2 IS COMPLETE!
